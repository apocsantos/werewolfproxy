# Known limitations — 1.0.0-rc.1

- Certification covers Linux x86_64, target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, tested
  on Debian 13.6 / glibc 2.41. Windows, macOS, ARM, BSD, containers and other
  libc baselines are not certified.
- Stage15B detects partial or mixed protected-state restoration. It does not
  detect a complete internally consistent historical Den or VM snapshot
  without an external freshness anchor.
- Stage16 bounds selected remote concurrency and lifetimes; it does not prevent
  distributed denial of service, bandwidth exhaustion, upstream attacks,
  starvation during sustained pre-auth saturation, or host resource failure
  outside configured bounds.
- Endpoints, transport type, packet sizes, timing and traffic volume remain
  visible. There is no cover traffic, constant-rate transmission, full size
  normalization, timing obfuscation, or multi-hop anonymity.
- Root, a privileged administrator, kernel compromise, or offline access to
  the host storage can undermine confidentiality or restore older state.
- WerewolfProxy does not make a compromised application or target trustworthy.
- There is no Windows service support, GUI, automatic remote trust
  provisioning, or pairing protocol. Peer public keys are exchanged out of
  band.
- The release binaries dynamically use the tested Linux runtime libraries;
  no compatibility claim is made for older glibc systems.
- Stage20 did not execute netem packet loss/jitter/reordering, direct ENOSPC,
  read-only filesystem, host clock changes, or systemd restart chaos. Related
  focused persistence, lifecycle, outage and monotonic-time tests exist in
  earlier stage suites, but do not substitute for those specific Stage20
  campaigns.
- The three Cargo workspace packages retain internal package version 0.1.0;
  release binaries and archive identify as 1.0.0-rc.1. This distinction is
  documented in the release audit.
